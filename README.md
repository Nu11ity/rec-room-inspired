# Rec Room Inspired

With the aim of streamlining the VR development process, I crafted a comprehensive multiplayer template that serves as a solid foundation for future projects. This template embodies the core elements necessary for any successful VR multiplayer experience, including intuitive locomotion, seamless interaction mechanics, crystal-clear voice communication, and robust peer-to-peer networking capabilities.

## Information

All project contents excluding the scripts folder have been removed due to licensing. This project is based on the series by Iron Head Games.
